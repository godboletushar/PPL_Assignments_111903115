1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables have a suffix `(D)'?
Ans Yes, every time a local variable has been used as an operand, it uses a new suffix, since every variable may be assigned at most once. Variables like formal parameters and local variables that may be used before any assignment are suffixed with 'D'.


2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI statements?
The paths of the two assignments to variable 'a' and 'b' merge in the basic block <bb 5>, at the statement c = a + b. The PHI statements have been introduced to assign the temporary versions of 'a' and 'b' their correct values, depending on the path of control flow (whether <bb 3> or <bb 4> was executed). The syntax of the PHI statements probably is:
# a_i = PHI <a_j(k), a_l(m), a_n(o),...>
where 'a_i' is a temporary version of the variable 'a' (used in the SSA form),
'a_j' is the temporary version of the variable 'a', such that the value of 'a' was assigned in <bb k>,
'a_l' is the temporary version of the variable 'a', such that the value of 'a' was assigned in <bb m>.
A finite number of such arguments can be used in the PHI statements. Each argument is the name of the temporary version used in the SSA form, followed by the number of the basic block in which it had been assigned that particular value.


3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two versions of a variable?
Ans If the value of 'a' had more than 2 possible versions, the PHI node would merge all those versions of the variable.
Eg: In the given code, if we replace
else {
  a = 2;
  b = 3;
}
by
else if (c > d) {
      a = 2;
      b = 3;
}
else {
    a = 4;
    b = 5;
}

In this case, the PHI node would merge 3 possible versions of 'a' (whose values are 3, 2 and 4) and 3 possible versions of 'b' (whose values are 2, 3 and 5).
